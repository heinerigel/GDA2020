**Course Schedule**

In case there are problems with the internet connection, please go forward with the slides and the Jupyter notebooks! The solutions to the Jupyter notebook exercises will be provided in the afternoon! The best strategy is to download the entire repository and work on the notebooks locally. Best practice is, if you immediately make a copy of a downloaded notebook in order to always have an original. Then modify the copy!

*Tuesday*

- The focus is on understanding the Fourier transform, and estimating spectra
- In the notebook Folder P03a-c contain fundamental maths prerequisites that you are welcome to go through!
- P04 contains note books about Fourier Series, simples spectra. 
- Go from a-c,  c is a simple intro to convolution. 
- P05 is an exmple of spectral estimation for Earth's free oscillations. 

10:00 Lecture Fourier Basis

13:00 Lecture Spectral Estimation and Applications

16:00 Discussion and Wrap up



*Wednesday*

- The focus is on convolution, deconvolution, and filtering

10:00 Lecture Linear Systems

13:00 Lecture Filtering

16:00 Discussion and Wrap up
